# betacodeTranscriber
Convert Arabic betacode to transcription for OpenITI yml files

Use it here: https://pverkind.github.io/betacodeTranscriber/

Based on Maxim Romanov's Python script for Arabic betacode (see https://alraqmiyyat.github.io/2015/02-07.html)

The tool is created by Peter Verkinderen. In this forked version the conversion of Ø¬ is removed.
Additionally, years between hijri and gregorian calendars are automatically converted. For example, 1446AH is converted into 1446/2024 and 2024CE is converted into 1446/2024.
